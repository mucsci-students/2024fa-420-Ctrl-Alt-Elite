## Design Patterns
### 1. Model-View-Controller (MVC) 
- **Definition**: A design pattern that separates an application into three components—Model (data), View (UI), and Controller (logic)—to improve organization and scalability.

- **Usage**: In our UML editor project, we implement the MVC pattern by organizing our code into three main folders: **Model**, **View**, and **Controller**.

  - **Model**: This folder contains files responsible for the application's data and logic. The `UmlEditorModel.java` is the core model representing the current state of the UML editor. The other files in this folder, like `UmlClass.java`, `UmlRelationship.java`, and `JsonUtils.java`, define the UML elements, their relationships, and handle data serialization.

  - **View**: The View is responsible for presenting the data to the user. In our project, the **View** folder contains `GUI.java` and `CLI.java`. These files define the user interfaces for the UML editor: `GUI.java` handles the graphical user interface (GUI) with visual elements, and `CLI.java` provides a text-based interface for interacting with the UML data.

  - **Controller**: The **Controller** folder contains files like `UmlEditor.java`, `UmGuiController.java`, and `UmCliController.java`, which manage the interactions between the View and the Model. The controller listens for user inputs (such as adding or removing UML elements) from the View, modifies the Model accordingly, and updates the View to reflect the changes.

### 2. State
+ **Definition**: Alter an object's behavior when its state changes.

+ **Usage**: We used the State pattern in `UmlGuiController.java`. The `updateButtonStates()` function dynamically updates the enabled/disabled states of menu items based on the current state of the UML editor model. This ensures that only relevant options are available to the user, depending on the classes, fields, methods, and relationships present in the model.
  
### 3. Null Object
+ **Definition**: Designed to act as a "nothing" version of an object.

+ **Usage**: The **Null Object** pattern in our UML editor project is implemented in `UmlClass` to represent a method's parameters when the method was not assigned any parameters by the user. The logic has been abstracted so that an empty parameter object is handled independently from parameter objects with values, and is written in a way that it can be adjusted in the future.
    
### 4. Memento
+ **Definition**: Capture and restore an object's internal state, allowing for undo and redo functionality.

+ **Usage**: The **Memento** pattern in our UML editor project is implemented using the `UmlEditorModel` class to capture and restore the internal state of the UML editor. The key elements of this implementation are:

    - **State Representation**: The `UmlEditorModel` class represents the state of the UML editor, which includes all the data (such as UML classes, attributes, and relationships) the user interacts with. This model's state is essential for undo and redo functionality.

    - **Deep Copying**: When an action is performed (e.g., adding, removing, or modifying a UML element), a deep copy of the `UmlEditorModel` is created and saved in the `undoStack`. This ensures that the original state remains unchanged and is available for future reverts or redos. The `new UmlEditorModel(model)` is responsible for cloning the model.

    - **State Management**: The `undoStack` and `redoStack` store these deep copies of `UmlEditorModel`. The `undoState()` and `redoState()` methods allow the editor to navigate between different states of the model, enabling undo and redo operations. When an undo operation is performed, the most recent state is popped from the `undoStack` and pushed onto the `redoStack`. Similarly, when redo is invoked, the state is moved back to the `undoStack`.
 
### 5. Singleton
+ **Definition**: The Singleton design pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance.
  
+ **Usage**: In our UML editor project, we apply the Singleton pattern to the `UmlEditorModel`. This pattern is implemented in the `UmlEditorModel.java` class, ensuring that there is only one instance of the model throughout the application. The singleton instance is accessed through the `getInstance()` method, which provides a global point of access to the model. This ensures consistency of the model state across the application and avoids the need for multiple instances of the model. Additionally, the `clone()` method has been overridden to allow for a deep copy of the model, enabling features like undo and redo functionality via the Memento pattern.

### 6. Adapter
+ **Definition**: The Adapter pattern allows incompatible interfaces to work together by converting one interface into another.

+ **Usage**: In our UML editor, we use the Adapter pattern with `UmlClassAdapter` and `UmlEditorModelAdapter` in the `Model` to handle JSON serialization and deserialization. These adapters convert `UmlClass` and `UmlEditorModel` objects into a format Gson can process, ensuring proper saving and loading of UML data. The adapters handle converting complex objects into JSON and vice versa, maintaining the integrity of the editor's state.
